# Planning
My planning started from creating wireframes and users stories. I used it to start
the project, to have a basic idea of which first steps I need to take and what
to ecpect from it as a result.

# Development Process
When I were developing my project I started from structuring my HTML file and
added some basic css to it. After that I worked on my User APIs. From curl scripts,
event handlers and AJAX requests to "success" and "fail" UI's. After I was able
to create an account and make some changes to it, I sterted working on game logic
and applying it to Game API's. During my "game creating" API I hit a hardest wall
of this project and had to change my game logic to work with each game update.
constantly console loging and seeing what each steps returns I was able to fix
it. I trully hope that my game become somehow enjoyable for users.

# Unsolved Issues
First thing to do would be styling. Creating a game that looks as good as it
works is defenetelly my first priority.
After that I would like to add an option to work against computer and online
agains a partner.
